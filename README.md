# CSFINALPROJEKT - J.A.N.K
## What is JANK?

### J.A.N.K. - or Just Awesome Nonsensical Knowledge- is a simulation design to give user feedback based on the time it takes for an unlikely event to happen, and the event in question
## Why JANK?

### While it is easy to say that your chance of getting eaten by a shark is one in a million, people are still terrified by sharks. On the other hand, you still have people drinking and driving despite the high probability of a crash, we wanted to express this relationship.
## How JANK?

### The game should be presented as an application with a user friendly interface that allows the user to set their name, habits, and the amount of times they want to run their simulation. Once run, the program will test for random values for each event, displaying the results of each game.
